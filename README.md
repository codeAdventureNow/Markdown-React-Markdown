# Mardown Previewer 

Through this project, I realized the power of leveraging packages as efficient tools to reach solutions rather than reinventing the wheel. Navigating extensive package documentation was challenging, but I found a streamlined solution with minimal dependencies, making troubleshooting easier and enabling a focus on core functionality. This experience emphasized the value of selecting appropriate tools, exploring documentation thoroughly, and embracing simplicity and efficiency in development.

## User Stories
&check;  I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".

&check;   I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

&check;  When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the text area.

&check; When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type.

&check; When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (H1 size), a sub heading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
