# Mardown Previewer 

Through this project, I realized the power of leveraging packages as efficient tools to reach solutions rather than reinventing the wheel. Navigating extensive package documentation was challenging, but I found a streamlined solution with minimal dependencies, making troubleshooting easier and enabling a focus on core functionality. This experience emphasized the value of selecting appropriate tools, exploring documentation thoroughly, and embracing simplicity and efficiency in development.
